## Dockerizing a Rails App

##### Dockerfile
```docker
FROM rails:onbuild
```

##### command line
```shell
docker build -t stsilabs/closed-sales-api -f Dockerfile-api /home/vagrant && \
docker run -it -p "8080:3000" stsilabs/closed-sales-api
```

`could not connect to server: No such file or directory Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?`

+ [Google `docker rails postgres`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/)
  + create a `docker-compose.yml`
    + `build: ./Dockerfile-api` => error
    + `Version 2` => uncompatible engine
    + `image: rails:onbuild` => no context directory
    + rename `Dockerfile-api` => error still present
    + `ports` on `postgres` => nope
    + `command: bundle exec rake db:setup` => nope
    + setup .env && `env_file: /home/vagrant/.env` => nope
    + updating `database.yml` => noticing that `host` does not appear in the ruby connection string
      + `Couldn't create database for {"adapter"=>"postgresql", "encoding"=>"unicode", "pool"=>5, "password"=>"bar", "database"=>"closedsales_development"}`
      + `docker rmi vagrant_web` => connection string is correct, but tries to login as root
    + changing `Dockerfile` to explicitly build rather than use `onbuild` => progress, but still stopped
    + add `username` to `database.yml` && updates `ports` in `docker-compose.yml` => success?

---

+ Resetting
  + In `docker-compose.yml`, reset the command to ` command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'`
  + `docker compose down`
  + `docker compose up`

```
ActiveRecord::PendingMigrationError
Migrations are pending. To resolve this issue, run: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
```

+ Init step must be different from run step AND init must be perisistent
  1. use a volume on the database image
  1. `docker-compose down && docker-compose build`
  1. `docker-compose run api rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`
  1. `docker-compose up`

+ According to [docker compose rails](https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/) the `up` and `rake` need to be run at the same time
  1. `docker-compose down && docker-compose build`
  1. `docker-compose up -d`
  1. `docker-compose run api rake db:create`
  1. `docker-compose run api rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`
  1. `docker-compose run api rake db:seed`

##### Include the app image in docker-compose
